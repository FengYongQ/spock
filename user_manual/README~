If it has not done been already, you first need to install SpOCK. See INSTALL.
   
Once SpOCK is installed, in the 'spock' folder you’ll see 7 folders:
- src: includes the orbit propagator code
- srcPython: Python scripts for the post-processing (you might not be able to use most of them as they are almost not commented). If you're interested in learning how to use them, email me at cbv@umich.edu
- Examples: examples of SpOCK input files (main input, geometry, tle, attitude, ground station)
- user_manual: documentation with instructions to run SpOCK
- cspice: SPICE libraries used in SpOCK 
- gsl_installation: GSL libraries used in SpOCK
- mpi_installation: directory with MPI (optional, you don't have to use MPI, you can compile with gcc -> refer to document "switch_gcc_and_mpicc")
- if somebody already used SpOCK here, then there might be other directories. These correspond to run directories where simulations were run.

From now on, the directory './' refers to the directory 'spock'.

How to run SpOCK (steps 1 to 3 only if nobody has ever run SpOCK here before):
1. Make sure that the Makefile is consistent with the path of the gsl and cspice directories (SPICE_DIR and GSL_DIR), as well as the compiler path (variable CC in the Makefile). Note that if you run SpOCK for the first time and get an error, it is probably due to an error at this step.
2. make clean (if you've never compiled SpOCK before then skip this step)
3. make all rundir 
This command compiles the code and creates the directory called run (feel free to rename this run directory if you want!). By default, this will use mpicc. If you don't want to use mpicc but gcc, see document "switch_gcc_and_mpicc".
4. cd run
You’ll see 2 folders:
- output: empty for now, where the output will be created (step 5)
- input: a bunch of folders. The most important are main_input (where you put the input file that tells SpOCK what to do (epoch, number of satellites, initial position/velocity, attitude, etc. -> see the user manual “main_input_file”)), geometry (where you put the geometry file), and tle (if you initialize the orbit with a TLE)
5. mpirun -np 1 spock ex_main_input_basic.txt
This command runs SpOCK with the input file ex_main_input_basic.txt located in input/main_input. Note that in this run command, you should not indicate the path of the main input file (so do not type 'mpirun –np 1 spock input/main_input/ex_main_input_basic.txt').
If you used gcc to compile SpOCK (step 3), see document "switch_gcc_and_mpicc".

There is a "bugs" file that you might want to have a look at if encoutering any problem while using SpOCK.

A final note: the most important document in the user manual is main_input_file. So read it first! The other documents are details about the most complex points described in the document "main_input_file".
