0. By default, you need to have MPI installed. If you don't have MPI installed, then you can use gcc as the compiler. For this, please refer to the document "switch_gcc_and_mpicc"

1. Download and install GSL C version
http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
If you get errors while compiling SpOCK (step 6), you probably need to rm:
- libgsl.so.19
- libgslcblas.so.0
- any other lib that might cause errors

2. Download and install Spice for C
http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/toolkit_C.html

3. Download Spice data files for leap seconds, earth orientation parameters, and planetary ephemerides, at http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/:
“naif0011.tls”
“pck00010.tpc”
“de430.bsp”
.tls are the leap seconds file and found in the lsk directory in the above link
.tpc are the earth orientation parameters and found in the pck directory in the above link
.bsp files are the ephemerides files and are found in the spk/planets directory in the above link
Put these three files in the cspice folder of step 2, in cspice/data/

4. In the cspice folder (see step 2.), add in cspice/data/ the attached file 'earth_000101_160830_160608.bpc'

5. Edit the makefile in directory 'spock'. The SPICE_DIR and the GSL_DIR should be changed to the install directories of SPICE and GSL from steps 1. & 2. Also, make sure the compiler path (CC variable) is set up correctly. 

6. make all rundir
By default, this will use mpicc. If you don't want to use mpicc but gcc, refer to the document "switch_gcc_and_mpicc"

There is a "bugs" file that you might want to have a look at if encoutering any problem while using SpOCK.
