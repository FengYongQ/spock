check diagonalisation of covariance matrix process is correct
debug for cases without any tca found
try case 1 alfano start 1 min before tca -> need to change code so it stops at start of array when going backward in time spanning tca
check that eci at tca after propagation from epoch is same as one provided by alfano
try with cases from chao




ideas:
- look at distirbutino at tca and see if std on x y z is the same as from the covariacne matrix at tca (conerted in eci frame)
- try taking the std directly from the covariance matrix instead of daig elements/converted back to eci


findings:
- using the method i use to compute min distance between ensembles to callculated min distance for unpertubrd orbits give the same result at alfano (exact same tc and dca)
- also, i find the same number of collisions (lokking only at steps) as post processing with python
-> these two points prove that the way to calculate min distance and ocllision is correct. 

- the number of collision at steps if 0.65. This means there are too many collisions (even only looking at steps)
-> this point suggests that the distributions of the sc are not ok

- most of the time (99% of the time), when 2 sc are closer than the min distance of collision, they are also at STEPS (in other words not really useful to use interpolation)

- eci x and y vary like a sine as funciton of time, so if we are at a max (of x for instance) then the sc will have the x vary less fast so the std at that time will be smaller then if we are at the ax of the slope of x, where x varies very fast (and where therefore the std will tbe bigger) 
-> it sucks to have the covariance matrices in ECI!
