looks like for equi to class the column M: 1st row and 2nd row have same expression in Vallado 15 but with opposite sign -> Vallado 15 incorrect (indeed, when I input the eq of Vallado 03 I get the same mumerical answeer as in Vallado 15 (so Valddao 15 numerical answer is correc tbut not the equation)

vallado15: sinL and cosL for quin to cart are wrong - compare to Danielson95

vallado15: matrix equi  to cart column psi is wrong. shouldnt be "2(fr" but "2fr(" (compare to danielson95)
