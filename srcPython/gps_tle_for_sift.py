# This script downloads the GPS TLEs at the epoch specified by tle_epoch (the TLE right "before" (older than) tle_epoch). The input are the tle epoch and the SpOCK run directory where to store the TLEs. These are given as argumeents of this script
# Methodology: the TLEs are taken from space-track.org. But to do so, you need to put the name of the GPS that are currently operational. Since I don't know how to find which GPS are currently operational, I use celestrack.com, which has a link that directly gives the TLEs of the currently operational GPS. But using this link only forces us to use the latest TLEs. So I use this link only to get the list of the NORAD ID of the current operational GPS. Then I input this list on space-track.org to get the TLEs for this list for the tle_epoch chosen by the user
# Summary of methodology:
# 1- get latest TLEs of operational GPS at celestrak
# 2- from the TLEs at celestrak, get the NORAD IDs of the operational GPS
# 3- download TLEs of these GPS from space-track for the epoch tle_epoch
# Assumptions:
## - tle_epoch must have the format "YYYY-MM-DD"
