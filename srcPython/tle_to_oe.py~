# This script reads a TLE file (with 1 or more TLE(s)) and compute the keplerian
# orbital elements
# Important note: although this method can give an idea of the values of the
# keplerian elements, it's not neither accurate nor theoretically correct
# The correct approach would be to conver the TLEs to ECI r/v, then convert the
# ECI r/v to osculating elements.
