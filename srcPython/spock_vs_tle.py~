# This script compares the position predicted by SpOCK to the one reported in

# position of SpOCK between two time steps at the TLE epochs
# No need to previously downlaod the TLEs, this script does it
# Inputs:
# - date_start: start date of the analysis (YYYY-mm-dd)
# - date_stop: stop date of the analysis (YYYY-mm-dd)
