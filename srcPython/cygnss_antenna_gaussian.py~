# This script creates gaussian nadir pattern with no azimuth dependence
# and a set half power beam width (e.g. 30 deg). It creates the fine
# and coarse antennas, both in binary format following the format of
# tds-bop (see the header of the script cygnss_antenna_pattern.py for
# a complete description of the format
