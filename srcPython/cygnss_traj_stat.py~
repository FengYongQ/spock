# This script was made to answer Scott's email on Dec 4, 2018.
# The script:
1- reads the position and velocity (ECEF r/v) of a given FM between date_start and date_stop
2- converts ECEF r/v to ECI r/v
3- converts ECI r/v to osculating orbital elements
4- for each orbital element, compute distributions
