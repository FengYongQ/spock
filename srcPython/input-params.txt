; TDS Beacon Signal Generator Input Parameters

; Operation Mode
; Determines the way in which the paths between receiver,
; transmitter and specular point are used to affect the
; total delay and Doppler
; 1 = standard operation mode
; 2 = bench top mode: ignore path between beacon and receiver
; 3 = static mode: ignore all delay and Doppler due to geometry
operation_mode=2

; Center frequency, MHz
center_freq=1575.42

; Waveform output file signal strength scale factor (0.0 to 1.0)
wave_output_scale_factor=0.5

; Waveform output sample rate (MHz)
sample_rate=5.0

; Big endian output file byte order
; True for big endian, false for little endian
; (This switch currently doesn't control anything. Maybe later.))
big_endian=false

; Overpass CSV file path. This file is created by the TDS-1 Beacon
;  Overpass Planner (tds-bop) application and is named pass_N.csv, where
;  N is the tds-bop pass number.
; The file path may be relative to the currrent directory or
;  absolute. Always use / as directory delimiter (even on Windows).
;  Defaults to the current working directory.
pass_csv_file_path=PRN_20_eeeeetruncated.csv

; DDM test pattern file path. May be relative to the current directory or
;  absolute. Always use / as directory delimiter (even on Windows).
;  Defaults to the current working directory.
ddm_pattern_file_path=pattern_goodvibes_v2.bin

; SP3 file path. This is the most recent SP3 file available from the IGS
;  FTP server at ftp://igscb.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/product/
;  Note that the SP3 files on the ftp server are compressed and must
;  be decompressed (unzipped) for beacon-sig-gen usage.
; May be relative to the currrent directory or
;  absolute. Always use / as directory delimiter (even on Windows).
;  Defaults to the current working directory.
sp3_file_path=ieeeeeegs20254.sp3

; Output file directory. All the files created by beacon-sig-gen are
;  written to this directory.
;  May be relative to the currrent directory or
;  absolute. Always use / as directory delimiter (even on Windows).
;  Defaults to the current working directory.
output_directory=PRN_20_eeeeetruncated_ieeeeeegs20254.bin

; Fiducial delay (seconds)
;  The fiducial is an absence of reflected GPS power in the waveform.
;  The fiducial delay is the number of seconds between the start of
;  transmission and the start of the fiducial.
fiducial_delay=0

; Fiducial duration (seconds)
fiducial_duration=0
