# This function computes the radius of the circle, which is the project cone in which a sc is in sight of the gs
# inputs:
# - h: altitude of the sc (take a mean altitude if eccentricity is non 0). In km
# - elev: mask elevation of the ground station (sc under this elev are not in sight). In degrees
# output:
# - radius of circle, which is the projected cone on the surface of the Earth
